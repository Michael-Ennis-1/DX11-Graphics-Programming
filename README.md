# DX11-Graphics-Programming

This is a demonstration of my small graphics scene for the CMP301 Graphics Programming module, using C++, DirectX11 and HLSL. This showcases a Tessellated Displacement Map, with mathematically calculated Lighting Normals (Both per-vertex and per-pixel). T
This is my CMP301 Graphics Programming module, using C++ DirectX11.

## Techniques Demonstracted
These are demonstrated through the use of a Directional, Spot and Point light respectively. The Spot and Directional light cast Shadows onto the Displacement Map. There is a Depth of Field post process that can be toggled too, to effectively showcase rendering the screen to a texture and manipulating it dynamically.
