# DX11-Graphics-Programming
My CMP301 Graphics Programming module, using C++ DirectX11. This is a small graphics scene, showcasing a Tessellated Displacement Map, with mathematically calculated Lighting Normals (Per vertex, with the mesh being 100 vertices originally but changing due to Tessellation), that can also be calculated per pixel (Bump Mapping technique). These are demonstrated through the use of a Directional, Spot and Point light respectively. The Spot and Directional light cast Shadows onto the Displacement Map. There is a Depth of Field post process that can be toggled too, to effectively showcase rendering the screen to a texture and manipulating it dynamically.
